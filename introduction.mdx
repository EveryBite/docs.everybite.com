## What You Can Build

### Personalized Menu Experiences
Give diners menus that understand their dietary needs. Filter by vegan, gluten-free, or any dietary preference. Exclude allergens automatically. Show nutrition information that matters.

### Allergen-Safe Dining
Protect your diners with comprehensive allergen detection. Our Match Status system tells you exactly which dishes are safe, which can be modified, and which to avoid.

### Build-Your-Own Dishes
Support customizable dishes with real-time nutrition calculation. As diners select their base, toppings, and sauces, see nutrition and allergen information update instantly.

### Cross-Restaurant Profiles
With EveryBite Passport, diners carry their preferences everywhere. Set allergies once, and they're known at every participating restaurant.

### Unified Loyalty
Connect multiple loyalty programs under one Passport. Diners earn and redeem rewards seamlessly across brands.

## Quick Example

Fetch vegan dishes under 600 calories, excluding dairy:

```graphql
query {
  dishes(
    menuKey: "your_menu_key",
    filters: {
      diets: [Vegan],
      excludeAllergens: [Dairy],
      calorieRange: { max: 600 }
    }
  ) {
    results {
      dish {
        name
        calories
        nutrition { protein, carbohydrates, fatTotal }
      }
