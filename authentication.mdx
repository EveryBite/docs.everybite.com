# Authentication

All EveryBite API requests require authentication using a Menu Key. This page explains how keys work and what access levels are available.

## Menu Keys

A **Menu Key** identifies which restaurant brand's menu data your application can access. Think of it as your API credential scoped to specific menu data.

```bash
# Include your Menu Key in the Authorization header
Authorization: Bearer hg_live_abc123def456...
```

## Key Types and Access Levels

Menu Keys are issued at different levels of the restaurant hierarchy, depending on your relationship with the brand.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Restaurant Key">
    **For:** Single-location restaurants or franchisees

    **Access:** One restaurant location and its menus

    ```
    Restaurant Key
    └── Single Location
        └── All menus at that location
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Chain Key">
    **For:** Restaurant chains with multiple locations

    **Access:** All restaurants in the chain and their menus

    ```
    Chain Key
    └── All Locations (e.g., 50 Honeygrow locations)
        └── All menus (may include regional variations)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Brand Key">
    **For:** Parent companies with multiple chains

    **Access:** All chains, all restaurants, all menus

    ```
    Brand Key
    └── Chain A (e.g., Taco Bell)
    │   └── All Taco Bell locations
    └── Chain B (e.g., KFC)
    │   └── All KFC locations
    └── Chain C (e.g., Pizza Hut)
        └── All Pizza Hut locations
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Getting Your Key

1. **Sign up** at [developer.everybite.com](https://developer.everybite.com)
2. **Request access** to a specific brand's menu data
3. **Receive approval** from the brand administrator
4. **Get your Menu Key** in your developer dashboard

<Warning>
Keep your Menu Key secure. Do not expose it in client-side code or public repositories. Use environment variables and server-side requests.
</Warning>

## Environments

Each Menu Key has separate credentials for sandbox and production:

| Environment | Base URL | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Sandbox | `https://api.everybite-stage.com/graphql` | Testing and development |
| Production | `https://api.everybite.com/graphql` | Live data |

<Info>
Sandbox keys have the prefix `_sandbox` and access test data that mirrors production structure.
</Info>

## Diner Preferences (Per-Request)

In addition to your Menu Key, you can pass **Diner Preferences** with each request to personalize results:

```graphql
query {
  dishes(
    menuKey: "your_menu_key",
    dinerPreferences: {
      diets: [Vegan, GlutenFree],
      excludeAllergens: [Peanut, Dairy],
      calorieRange: { min: 200, max: 600 }
    }
  ) {
    results {
      dish { name }
      matchStatus  # Calculated based on dinerPreferences
    }
  }
}
```

Diner Preferences are not stored - they're applied per-request. For persistent preferences, use [EveryBite Passport](/passport/overview).

## Passport Tokens

If integrating with EveryBite Passport, you'll also work with **Passport Tokens** for authenticated diners:

```graphql
query {
  dishes(
    menuKey: "your_menu_key",
    passportToken: "diner_passport_token"  # Loads their saved preferences
  ) {
    results {
      dish { name }
      matchStatus  # Based on their Passport preferences
    }
  }
}
```

See [Passport Authentication](/passport/overview#authentication) for details.

## Rate Limits

| Key Type | Requests/minute | Requests/day |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Restaurant | 60 | 10,000 |
| Chain | 300 | 100,000 |
| Brand | 1,000 | Unlimited |

Rate limit headers are included in every response:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 300
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 297
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1703001600
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| `INVALID_MENU_KEY` | Key is malformed or expired | Check your key, request a new one if expired |
| `UNAUTHORIZED_BRAND` | Key doesn't have access to requested brand | Request access to the brand |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests | Slow down, implement backoff |
| `KEY_REVOKED` | Key has been revoked | Contact support |
